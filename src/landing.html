              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                 A lot of people are talking about the rapidly changing car industry, 
                 self-driving cars, innovative car-sharing concepts and, most importantly,
                 electric vehicles (EVs). A new era of mobility has begun - so they say.
                 But has it really?
              </p>
              <p>
                 In reality, the total number of EVs sold is still staggeringly low compared to
                 convential ICE cars - despite of various incentives to buy electric.
                 That is because most car manufacturers have been struggling to
                 provide electric cars that are both attractive <i>and</i> affordable for the masses.
              </p>
              <p>
                <h4>Electric vehicles</h4>
                <div class="feature-icon">
                    <i class="material-icons">directions_car</i>
                </div>
              </p>
              <p>
                 Companies like Tesla, BMW, Nissan, Renault, GM already have some great electric cars in their portfolio,
                 but these cars are new in the market and they are expensive.
                 Some of them are taking mobility to the next level, fundamentally changing the expectations
                 consumers have about how they interact with their cars.
              </p>
              <p>
                  EVs are more than just cars. They are full of cool technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                <h4>Smartphone on wheels</h4>
                <div class="feature-icon">
                    <i class="material-icons">phone_android</i>
                </div>
              </p>
              <p>
                 Today's and upcoming EVs will be equipped with powerful
                 computers and sensors that allow for all kinds of new features and safety measures.
                 You will be able to control functions of your car from your phone, check its status, 
                 let it pick you up, auto-park or pull out of a tight parking spot for you - or even let it just drive autonomously.
                 On top of that, these cars will be much safer than any of today's convential ICE cars.
              </p>
              <p>
                 And electric cars are fun to drive. Given all that, who wouldn't want to have that cool new car 
                 of the future that is kind of like the new iPhone?
              </p>
              <p>
                <h4>Costs</h4>
                <div class="feature-icon">
                    <i class="material-icons">attach_money</i>
                </div>
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a caveat, though. Cars are not smartphones. They cost more. Much more. 
                As much as you would love to buy that new Tesla or any other new car for that matter,
                these cars are really not cheap. And with some little extras that you
                wouldn't want to miss in your new car you will easily reach a price level that might
                not be affordable for you  - at least if you don't want to blow all your life savings on
                an electric car.
              </p>
              <p>
                So what can you do to get that new great car, your own, personal car that you
                can relate to, while significantly reduce the price you have to pay for that car?
              </p>
              <p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>

                </div>

                If you don't require to have exclusive access to your car on a 24/7 basis,
                then we believe my-ev-ride might just be the right solution for you.

                            Electric vehicles are cleaner, safer and more sustainable than conventional cars.
                            Even though the concept of co-owning is not only applicable to electric vehicles, we want to promote the 
                            idea of cleaner transportation and use the current market momentum to make new electric cars affordable to a broader
                            range of customers.

                            With platform-based co-owning, we take car-sharing to a different level. A level that allows you to
                            have your own car that you can relate to and that is available for you whenever you need it while still
                            giving you the chance to significantly reduce the costs.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Sharing your car with other people without the support of a co-owning platform can induce
                            all sorts of problems.
                            Who is getting the car on Saturday? Who pays the insurance rates?
                            What happens if there is an accident? How is car depreciation split in a fair way among owners?
                            All these things are taken care of by the platform in a transparent and simple way.

                  What would your favorite car look like? Go to the various manufacturer websites and configure
                  the car of your dreams, with all the extras you like. If you like you may note down a description of your car and
                  its features along with its total projected price.

              <p>
                  <b><i>Step 2: Explore</i></b>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Visit my-ev-ride.com and check whether a car similar to your dream EV is already there for you at your location or in close range.
                  If not, just define the car of your dreams at your location for others to see and find on the platform.
                  Specify whether it is one, two, three or more other people you want to share the car with, according to
                  your needs. Note that the co-owning price is split equally among all co-owners so the level of identification
                  is the same for all.
